//[Definition]
// virtual function is declared within a base class 
// and is redefined(Override) by a derived class.
// You can refer a derived object with a base class pointer or reference to call a virtual function
// to execute the derived class's version of function
//
//[Note]
// virtual functions are mainly used to achieve Runtime Polymorphism
// The resolving of function call is done at Run-time.
