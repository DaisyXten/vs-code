# Diarrhea
1. If you feel stomach. Firstly if you can, eat more food, but not too much rice, with rice you can not digiest even more, you can make chicken guts soup.
Because new food will help the bad food to move
2. If you feel can not eat more food. Drink a lot of tea and go to toilet often. Don't drink tea when your stomach is empty, then you will feel too much gas.
3. One day after Diarrhea you may feel weak and want to eat porridge. You may eat porridge, because others maybe too oily
You can eat at most one meal of porridge, because if you always eat porridge, your stomach will not have strength and may not move so much. I had been stuck on this status for one month, because I ate porridge only and later always feel stomach too much gas and feel no strength. If you eat too much porridge, you will have many gas in your belly and you feel you have Diarrhea again.
