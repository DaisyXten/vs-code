# Sleep

1. Stay in warm place. You can not sleep maybe because air is too cold
2. The place can not be too hot especially watch out heating, it may eat the air. So better sleep in place with flowing air and not so hot too. 
2. Wear headmuffins. You have too sensitive hearing, just wear a headmuffin.
3. You may just be hungry. If above two does not work, consider this and eat rice or noodles with meat and fish
4. After food, do mediation.
5. Sleep at 8 or 9 o'clock. Anyway fall asleep before 10pm. After that it will be second wave of energy, but energy for regenerating body. If this wave you did not fall aslepp, next wave will be after 6 o'clock.
